# Ed's RPS Challenge

Instructions
-------

* clone / download the repo
* run ```bundle install```
* launch the game with ```ruby app.rb```
* note the port address 
* navigate to 'localhost:{portaddress}' in any browser, e.g. ```localhost:4567```

Progress
--------

* Main challenge complete
* Two player version complete
* Didn't get round to the spock/lizard version

If there'd been more time...
--------
* Haven't really done much refactoring
* Actual game method could be tidied up
  * think this would have happened as part of the final Spock/Lizard process
* Would have been nice to trim the number of pages
* Having two separate paths for the 1/2 player versions seems like overkill
* Think separate forms on the start page for 1/2 player is rubbish
  * don't really need Buttons for links, so could have used;
    * Radio buttons
    * href things
* CSS is slapdash, would have been nice to aim for something a bit more polished
* I wanted images instead of labelled buttons for the weapon choice!
